# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, demonstrating skills in data visualization, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, D3.js, and working with GeoJSON data.

## Overview

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides earthquake data in GeoJSON format, updated every 5 minutes. This project fetches earthquake data from the USGS API and visualizes it on a Leaflet map. The visualization includes:

-   Plotting earthquake locations based on latitude and longitude.
-   Using circle markers to indicate earthquake magnitude, with marker size proportional to magnitude.
-   Applying colors to markers based on earthquake depth.
-   Adding popups that display additional information about each earthquake when clicked.
-   Creating a legend to provide context for earthquake depths.

## Skills Demonstrated

-   **JavaScript**: Used for fetching data from APIs, manipulating GeoJSON data, and integrating with Leaflet and D3.js libraries.
-   **Leaflet.js**: Implemented to create interactive and customizable maps, including markers and popups.
-   **D3.js**: Utilized for data-driven visualizations, such as scaling earthquake magnitudes and colors.
-   **GeoJSON**: Handled GeoJSON data formats for mapping geographical features and properties.
-   **Data Visualization**: Demonstrated proficiency in visualizing complex data sets to convey meaningful insights.
-   **API Integration**: Fetched real-time earthquake data from the USGS API and integrated it into the visualization.

## Instructions

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set up a local development environment with Node.js and a web server.
3.  Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the earthquake visualization.
4.  Explore the map to interact with earthquake markers and popups.
